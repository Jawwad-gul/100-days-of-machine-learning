    "How will be answered when doing each of them in detail, here let's disscsuss why.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why?  \n",
    "To get the data in Normal distributed form. What is **Normal Distribution**.  \n",
    "_\"The values are spread around the mean in a bell-shaped way\"_   \n",
    "bell-shaped mean when we plot the kde plot (`sns.kdeplot()`) the resultant pdf (probability density function) that gets plotted would be a bell-shaped shape... line going higher in the center and lower on rear sides.  \n",
    "### Again Why?  \n",
    "**Why do we need the data Normally Distributed?**  \n",
    "Because the Linear models like Linear Rgression and Logistic Rgression expect the data to be Normally Distributed and perform well (give higher accuracy) when given the data that they expect.  \n",
    "### Again!  \n",
    "Why not use non-linear models like decision tree or random forest? Go ahead...   \n",
