    "now as we know that entropy is a measure of disorder. means it should be difficult to make accurate prediction with more entropy comapred to less entropy. now if we look carefully we can see that the scatter plot on the left has only few data point of class-green. which means in left there is veri high probability of red being predicted. and only a little chance of green which is not the case in left scatter plot. which means left scatter plot has higher value of entropy than the right plot.   \n",

    "## Takeaway:  \n",
    "Now we have calculated the Information Gain for all columns and selected Outlook as the root because it had the highest gain. The algorithm then splits the data into branches for every possible value of that root (Sunny, Overcast, and Rainy). Instead of picking just one child, the algorithm repeats the process for every branch independently. For each branch, we check the filtered data: if it is already 'pure' (all outcomes are the same,entropy=0), it becomes a final leaf node; if not, we calculate the Information Gain for the remaining columns within that specific branch to find the next best splitter. This recursive splitting continues until the entire tree is built.  \n",

    "Same thing as entropy, same purpose , different formula, and a little bit of difference...  \n",
    "formula to claculate for a binary problem: `1 - (Py^2 - Pn^2)`\n",
    "**Example**  \n",
    "Consider a binary classification data set... with 50% of yes and 50% of no.  \n",
    "Py = 0.5, Pn = 0.5. In this case Entropy is always maximum which is 1. where as in Gini Impurity case.. the maximum value that can be reached is 0.5, won't go higher than that.   \n",
    "so if the data is too large, we should use Gini impurity cuz its fast. whereas if the data is too imbalanced.. we should use entropy because it penalizes even the smaller changes.  \n",

    "![ytss](Assets/13_numericData.png)  \n",
    "1. First off sort the dataset based on your numeric column.\n",
    "2. based on every value in the user-rating column, we split the whole data set into two different ones. condition... `f > value1`. now only value1 is not greater than value1. so dataset splits into two different ones. D1 has only first row while D2 has all the others... just like that we split the data into two with all the values.\n",
    "3. After splitting we calculate all of the splitted data's entropy and then weightage average to finally calculate information gain. (entropy(parent) - Weigted_Avg*entropy).\n",
    "![ytss](assets/14_numericData.png)\n",
    "5.  Now we have n number of information gains. so we find the max from them and then split the tree based off of that value lets it was `f > value3`\n",
    "6. Finally we keep doing this until we reach the leaf node."
