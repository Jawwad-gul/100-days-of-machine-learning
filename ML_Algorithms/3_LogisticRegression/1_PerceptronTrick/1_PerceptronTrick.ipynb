    "in perceptron trick, first random values are taken of coefficients, then using those values a line is drawn, and then by verifying through random data points the line is moved and it keeps happening until it reaches the desired location where it has all or atleast maximum number of students classified correctly (got placement on one side (say right), didn't get placement on left).<br> **How?** <br>\n",
    "line always expects to have those students who got placement to be on its right side. so it will check from different data points and then if a certain data point is of the student who didn't get placement and its on the right side of the line... line will transform (change value of those coefficients) to the place where that point is on its left side, just like this it will keep transforming until it reaches the optmial position. \n",
