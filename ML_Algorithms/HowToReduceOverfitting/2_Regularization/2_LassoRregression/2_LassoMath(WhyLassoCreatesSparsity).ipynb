    "since differentiation of absolute m (|m|) is not possible due to sharp turn at minimum point. we take m as two separate values, first **when m > 0**, now when m is positive, |m| becomes m\n",

    "#### when m > 0\n",
    "with the gradual and continuous increase in the value of lambda, the numerator in the formula keeps decreasing until the whole terms ends up being 0, if the lambda is increased after that point... then m becomes negative... and for negative m, model automatically switches to case two where m < 0. and if that value of lambda (which was used in first case and m became negative) is used in the case two formula.. value of m increases... but the goal is actually to decrease the coefficient values, so model chooses the value of lambda where it produced the minimum value of m. \n",

    "For it to be 0, the numerator will have to be 0, which I think won't be happening in our lifetime... because all of the data will have to just 0s.\n",
    "nevertheless, if numerator is as far less as 0.000001, its still not possible that after division the result is 0.  \n",
